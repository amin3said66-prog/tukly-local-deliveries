# Tukly Local Deliveries

# TUKLY DELIVERY — MASTER PRODUCT & ENGINEERING PROMPT

## 1. PRODUCT VISION

Build a production-quality Egyptian last-mile delivery platform called:

# TUKLY

### توكلي

Tagline:

**"من محلك لباب العميل... التوك توك يوصّلها."**

English:

**"From your store to their door — delivered by TukTok."**

TUKLY is NOT a generic food-delivery clone and NOT a ride-hailing application.

It is a specialized:

**TukTok-powered last-mile delivery platform for Egyptian merchants, customers, and delivery captains.**

The platform connects:

* Customers

* Local merchants

* TukTok delivery captains

* Operations/admin teams

The core business problem:

Many Egyptian local businesses need affordable, flexible, short-distance delivery, especially in dense neighborhoods, narrow streets, markets, villages, and areas where larger vehicles are inefficient.

TUKLY uses TukToks as a specialized local delivery vehicle while providing modern digital logistics, tracking, pricing, merchant management, driver operations, and analytics.

# 2. IMPORTANT PRODUCT POSITIONING

Do NOT build:

* Uber clone

* Careem clone

* Talabat clone

* Generic courier clone

* Generic marketplace

* Passenger transportation application

Build a:

# LOCAL DELIVERY OPERATING SYSTEM

for merchants and TukTok delivery captains.

The main product value is:

**Fast local delivery + affordable logistics + merchant visibility + captain efficiency.**

---

# 3. TARGET USERS

Create four distinct experiences.

## A. CUSTOMER

Customers should be able to:

* Create account

* Login

* Manage profile

* Save addresses

* Receive delivery

* Track delivery

* View delivery status

* See captain information

* Contact support

* View delivery history

* Rate delivery

* Report delivery problem

Customer does NOT need a complicated marketplace in MVP.

The customer can primarily receive deliveries created by merchants or send a delivery request.

---

# 4. MERCHANT

The Merchant experience is one of the most important parts of the application.

Merchant dashboard must include:

### Dashboard

Display:

* Today's orders

* Pending deliveries

* Active deliveries

* Completed deliveries

* Failed deliveries

* Cancelled deliveries

* Total delivery cost

* Average delivery time

* Success rate

Include visual analytics.

---

## Merchant Order Creation

Merchant can create:

### New Delivery

Fields:

* Customer name

* Customer phone

* Pickup address

* Delivery address

* Package type

* Package description

* Package size

* Package weight

* Special instructions

* Cash collection required

* COD amount

* Preferred delivery time

* Delivery priority

Package types:

* Food

* Grocery

* Clothing

* Electronics

* Documents

* Pharmacy

* Small parcel

* Other

Do NOT make medical/pharmacy delivery claim to be legally approved.

Treat regulated products as configurable categories requiring operational/legal approval.

---

# 5. DELIVERY REQUEST FLOW

The main merchant flow:

Merchant creates delivery.

↓

System validates:

* Pickup location

* Delivery location

* Service zone

* Package size

* Vehicle capability

* Delivery availability

↓

Calculate estimated delivery price.

↓

Merchant confirms request.

↓

System searches for eligible nearby captains.

↓

Captain receives request.

↓

Captain accepts.

↓

Order becomes:

# ASSIGNED

↓

Captain travels to pickup.

↓

Captain confirms:

# ARRIVED_AT_PICKUP

↓

Merchant hands package to captain.

↓

Captain confirms:

# PICKED_UP

↓

Customer receives live tracking.

↓

Captain travels to destination.

↓

Captain confirms:

# ARRIVED_AT_DESTINATION

↓

Customer receives package.

↓

Captain confirms:

# DELIVERED

↓

System records:

* Delivery duration

* Distance

* Captain earnings

* Merchant cost

* COD amount

* Platform commission

* Final status

↓

Customer/Merchant can rate the delivery.

---

# 6. DELIVERY STATUS STATE MACHINE

Implement a strict delivery state machine.

Statuses:

```text

DRAFT

PENDING

SEARCHING_CAPTAIN

ASSIGNED

CAPTAIN_EN_ROUTE_TO_PICKUP

ARRIVED_AT_PICKUP

PICKED_UP

IN_TRANSIT

ARRIVED_AT_DESTINATION

DELIVERED

FAILED

CANCELLED

EXPIRED

```

Do NOT allow arbitrary status changes.

Status transitions must be controlled.

Example:

PENDING

→ SEARCHING_CAPTAIN

SEARCHING_CAPTAIN

→ ASSIGNED

ASSIGNED

→ CAPTAIN_EN_ROUTE_TO_PICKUP

CAPTAIN_EN_ROUTE_TO_PICKUP

→ ARRIVED_AT_PICKUP

ARRIVED_AT_PICKUP

→ PICKED_UP

PICKED_UP

→ IN_TRANSIT

IN_TRANSIT

→ ARRIVED_AT_DESTINATION

ARRIVED_AT_DESTINATION

→ DELIVERED

---

# 7. CAPTAIN EXPERIENCE

Create a dedicated Captain dashboard.

Captain should see:

## Home

* Online/offline toggle

* Current zone

* Today's earnings

* Completed deliveries

* Active delivery

* Acceptance rate

* Rating

* Available requests

---

## Delivery Request Card

Show:

* Pickup area

* Destination area

* Distance

* Estimated time

* Package type

* Package size

* Estimated earning

* COD amount if applicable

* Special instructions

Actions:

* Accept

* Reject

---

# 8. CAPTAIN DELIVERY SCREEN

After accepting:

Display:

### PICKUP

* Merchant name

* Pickup address

* Contact

* Package information

* Navigation button

Then:

### PICKUP CONFIRMATION

Captain must confirm package collection.

Then:

### DELIVERY

Display:

* Customer name

* Destination

* Phone

* COD amount

* Delivery instructions

Actions:

* Call customer

* Navigate

* Mark arrived

* Confirm delivered

---

# 9. CAPTAIN EARNINGS

Create a professional earnings dashboard.

Show:

* Today

* This week

* This month

* Total earnings

* Delivery earnings

* Bonuses

* Penalties

* Platform fees

* Net earnings

Charts:

* Daily earnings

* Deliveries per day

* Average delivery value

Do not implement real payment processing in MVP.

Use mock financial data and clear "Demo" indicators where appropriate.

---

# 10. ADMIN / OPERATIONS DASHBOARD

Admin dashboard is critical.

Build it like a real logistics operations center.

Sections:

### Overview

KPIs:

* Total deliveries

* Active deliveries

* Pending deliveries

* Delivered today

* Failed deliveries

* Cancelled deliveries

* Active captains

* Online captains

* Active merchants

* Revenue

* Platform commission

---

# 11. LIVE OPERATIONS MAP

Create a professional map-oriented operations screen.

Display:

* Active captains

* Pickup locations

* Delivery locations

* Active orders

* Service zones

Each captain marker should visually indicate:

* Online

* Busy

* Available

* Offline

Use mock coordinates.

Do not require real GPS infrastructure for MVP.

Architect the UI so real-time GPS can be connected later.

---

# 12. SERVICE ZONES

This is an important business feature.

Create:

# Service Zone Management

Admin can manage:

* Zone name

* City

* Area

* Status

* Delivery radius

* Base delivery fee

* Per-km fee

* Maximum package weight

* Maximum package dimensions

* Operating hours

Examples:

* Tanta

* Mahalla

* Alexandria

* Giza

* Cairo

* Mansoura

Use fictional/demo operational configurations.

Do not claim that the platform is legally authorized to operate in every listed location.

The platform should support configurable service zones because TukTok operation can be subject to local operational restrictions.

---

# 13. PRICING ENGINE UI

Build a configurable pricing system.

Example formula:

```text

Delivery Price =

Base Fee

+ Distance Fee

+ Package Size Fee

+ Priority Fee

+ Optional Waiting Fee

```

Admin can configure:

* Base fee

* Price per kilometer

* Minimum delivery fee

* Maximum delivery fee

* Large package surcharge

* Priority surcharge

* Waiting fee

* Zone-specific pricing

Show pricing breakdown transparently.

Example:

```text

Base delivery       25 EGP

Distance             12 EGP

Package handling      5 EGP

---------------------------

Total                42 EGP

```

Do NOT hard-code business pricing throughout the UI.

Centralize pricing configuration.

---

# 14. MERCHANT MANAGEMENT

Admin can:

* View merchants

* Approve merchant

* Suspend merchant

* View merchant profile

* View merchant orders

* View merchant performance

* View merchant revenue

* View merchant delivery success rate

Merchant profile:

* Business name

* Owner

* Phone

* Email

* Address

* Business category

* Branches

* Status

* Created date

* Total deliveries

---

# 15. CAPTAIN MANAGEMENT

Admin can:

* View captains

* Approve captain

* Suspend captain

* Activate/deactivate captain

* View captain rating

* View captain performance

* View delivery history

* View earnings

* View vehicle information

Captain profile:

* Full name

* Phone

* Status

* Rating

* Total deliveries

* Acceptance rate

* Completion rate

* Average delivery time

* Current zone

* Vehicle type

* Vehicle status

For MVP, verification documents should be represented by mock/document placeholders only.

Do not store or expose sensitive identity documents unnecessarily.

---

# 16. ORDER MANAGEMENT

Admin order table:

Columns:

* Order ID

* Merchant

* Customer

* Captain

* Pickup

* Destination

* Status

* Price

* COD

* Created

* Updated

Filters:

* Status

* Date

* Merchant

* Captain

* Zone

* Package type

Search:

* Order ID

* Customer

* Merchant

* Phone

---

# 17. ORDER DETAILS

Order details page should feel like a real logistics tracking system.

Sections:

### Summary

* Order ID

* Current status

* Created at

* Estimated delivery time

### Customer

* Name

* Phone

* Address

### Merchant

* Name

* Pickup location

### Timeline

Example:

```text

09:32 Order created

09:34 Captain assigned

09:41 Captain arrived pickup

09:44 Package picked up

09:58 Arrived destination

10:02 Delivered

```

---

# 18. CUSTOMER TRACKING EXPERIENCE

Create a beautiful tracking page.

Top:

## Your delivery is on the way

Show:

* Current status

* Estimated arrival

* Captain

* Vehicle

* Rating

Map section:

* Pickup marker

* Destination marker

* Captain marker

* Route line

Bottom:

Delivery timeline.

For MVP use simulated movement/mock data.

Structure the code so a real WebSocket/SSE/SignalR service can later replace the simulation.

---

# 19. NOTIFICATIONS

Build notification center.

Types:

* Delivery assigned

* Captain arriving

* Package picked up

* Delivery approaching

* Delivered

* Cancelled

* Payment/COD update

* System notification

Use realistic Egyptian Arabic notification copy.

Example:

"الكابتن محمد استلم طلبك وبدأ التوصيل."

"طلبك قرب يوصل."

"تم تسليم الطلب بنجاح."

---

# 20. SUPPORT CENTER

Create support system.

Categories:

* Delivery problem

* Missing package

* Damaged package

* Wrong address

* Captain issue

* Merchant issue

* Payment issue

* Other

Create:

* FAQ

* Support tickets

* Ticket status

* Conversation UI

Statuses:

```text

OPEN

IN_PROGRESS

WAITING_FOR_USER

RESOLVED

CLOSED

```

---

# 21. AUTHENTICATION UX

Create role-based authentication.

Roles:

```text

CUSTOMER

MERCHANT

CAPTAIN

ADMIN

OPERATIONS

SUPPORT

```

After login, route the user to the correct dashboard.

Use mock/demo authentication if backend authentication is not configured.

Architect authentication cleanly so Supabase Auth can be connected.

Do NOT fake security by storing sensitive credentials in frontend code.

---

# 22. DEMO MODE

Because this is an MVP/prototype, create a polished demo environment.

Provide demo users:

```text

Customer Demo

Merchant Demo

Captain Demo

Operations Demo

Admin Demo

```

Make it obvious that demo data is simulated.

The application should feel functional during demonstration.

---

# 23. DATABASE / BACKEND ARCHITECTURE

Use Supabase if backend functionality is required.

Recommended entities:

```text

profiles

customers

merchants

merchant_branches

captains

vehicles

service_zones

deliveries

delivery_status_history

delivery_items

addresses

pricing_rules

payments

wallet_transactions

ratings

notifications

support_tickets

support_messages

audit_logs

```

Use proper relationships.

Do not duplicate data unnecessarily.

Use IDs consistently.

Use timestamps:

```text

created_at

updated_at

```

Use status enums/constants where possible.

---

# 24. REAL-TIME ARCHITECTURE

Prepare the architecture for:

* Captain location updates

* Delivery status updates

* Order assignment

* Notifications

* Operations dashboard updates

Potential future implementation:

```text

Captain App

     ↓

Realtime Location

     ↓

Backend

     ↓

Realtime Channel

     ↓

Customer

     ↓

Operations Dashboard

```

For MVP:

Use simulated real-time updates.

Do NOT pretend simulated tracking is real GPS.

---

# 25. DESIGN DIRECTION

The UI must feel:

* Egyptian

* modern

* practical

* energetic

* trustworthy

* urban

* logistics-focused

Avoid generic startup UI.

Avoid copying Talabat, Uber, Careem, or other existing brands.

Create an original visual identity.

---

# 26. BRAND IDENTITY

Brand:

# TUKLY

Arabic:

# توكلي

Possible visual concept:

A modern simplified TukTok silhouette combined with:

* location pin

* package

* movement line

Logo should be simple and recognizable.

Do not use a literal cartoon TukTok.

Use a professional geometric mark.

---

# 27. COLOR SYSTEM

Create centralized design tokens.

Primary:

```text

Deep Navy

#102A43

```

Secondary:

```text

Egyptian Nile Blue

#167D9A

```

Accent:

```text

Warm Orange

#F28C28

```

Success:

```text

#2E8B57

```

Danger:

```text

#D64545

```

Background:

```text

#F7F8FA

```

Dark background:

```text

#0B1117

```

Do not scatter raw colors across components.

Use semantic CSS variables/tokens.

Example:

```text

--color-primary

--color-secondary

--color-accent

--color-background

--color-surface

--color-border

--color-muted

--color-success

--color-danger

```

---

# 28. TYPOGRAPHY

Arabic must feel native.

Use a modern Arabic-friendly font such as:

* IBM Plex Sans Arabic

* Noto Sans Arabic

For Latin:

* Inter

* Manrope

Typography must work correctly in both:

```text

Arabic RTL

English LTR

```

Do NOT simply mirror the English UI.

Arabic content must be properly localized.

---

# 29. BILINGUAL SUPPORT

Support:

```text

Arabic

English

```

Default:

```text

Arabic

```

Implement:

```text

ar

en

```

Switch:

```text

RTL ↔ LTR

```

The entire layout must react correctly.

Arabic UI examples:

```text

الرئيسية

الطلبات

التوصيلات

الكباتن

التجار

الأرباح

المناطق

الإعدادات

الدعم

```

English:

```text

Dashboard

Orders

Deliveries

Captains

Merchants

Earnings

Zones

Settings

Support

```

---

# 30. EGYPTIAN CULTURAL DIRECTION

The product should clearly feel designed for Egypt.

Use subtle references:

* Egyptian streets

* local stores

* neighborhood commerce

* Arabic-first UX

* cash on delivery

* local merchant behavior

* Egyptian address patterns

* local delivery terminology

Use realistic examples such as:

* طنطا

* المحلة الكبرى

* الإسكندرية

* القاهرة

* الجيزة

* المنصورة

Do NOT overuse:

* pyramids

* pharaohs

* flags

* stereotypical Egyptian imagery

This is a modern logistics company, not a tourism website.

---

# 31. ADDRESS UX

Egyptian addresses are often not standardized.

Create flexible address fields:

```text

Governorate

City

Area

Street

Building

Floor

Apartment

Landmark

Additional instructions

```

Example:

```text

طنطا

منطقة الاستاد

شارع البحر

عمارة 12

الدور الثالث

شقة 8

علامة مميزة:

بجوار صيدلية النور

```

This is very important for the product.

---

# 32. MAP UX

Build map-ready components.

Map must support:

* Pickup

* Destination

* Captain

* Route

* Service zones

For MVP, use mock map data if external map provider is unavailable.

Structure components so Google Maps / Mapbox / another provider can be integrated later.

Do not expose API keys in frontend source.

---

# 33. MOBILE-FIRST DESIGN

The application must work extremely well on:

```text

320px

375px

390px

430px

768px

1024px

1280px

1440px+

```

Mobile is extremely important.

Captain experience should prioritize mobile usability.

Buttons must be:

* large

* touch friendly

* easy to reach

* visually obvious

---

# 34. DESKTOP ADMIN DESIGN

Admin is desktop-first.

Use:

* Sidebar

* Top navigation

* KPI cards

* Tables

* Filters

* Charts

* Maps

* Detail drawers

* Modal dialogs

Responsive fallback must still exist.

---

# 35. COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE

Create reusable components.

Examples:

```text

AppShell

Sidebar

Topbar

PageHeader

StatCard

StatusBadge

DeliveryCard

CaptainCard

MerchantCard

OrderTable

OrderTimeline

MapContainer

TrackingCard

PricingBreakdown

AddressCard

EmptyState

LoadingState

ErrorState

ConfirmDialog

SearchInput

FilterBar

DateRangePicker

NotificationCenter

```

Do NOT duplicate components.

---

# 36. FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE

Use a scalable architecture.

Prefer:

```text

src/

  app/

  components/

  layouts/

  pages/

  features/

    deliveries/

    merchants/

    captains/

    customers/

    pricing/

    zones/

    tracking/

    notifications/

    support/

  services/

  stores/

  hooks/

  lib/

  types/

  data/

  i18n/

  styles/

```

Keep business logic outside UI components.

Avoid giant components.

Avoid duplicated business logic.

---

# 37. STATE MANAGEMENT

Use centralized state only where needed.

Examples:

* Auth

* Current user

* Language

* Theme

* Delivery state

* Notifications

Do not put every form field into global state.

Keep local UI state local.

---

# 38. THEMING

Support:

```text

Light

Dark

System

```

Theme must persist.

Do not create separate duplicated pages for dark mode.

Use semantic design tokens.

---

# 39. ANIMATION

Use subtle professional animations.

Examples:

* Card entrance

* Status transitions

* Sidebar transitions

* Map marker movement

* Toast notifications

* Modal transitions

Avoid excessive animation.

Support:

```text

prefers-reduced-motion

```

No distracting effects.

---

# 40. ICONS

Use a consistent icon library.

Prefer:

# Lucide Icons

Do NOT use emoji as interface icons.

No:

🚚

📦

📍

💰

Use proper SVG/icon components instead.

---

# 41. TABLE UX

Tables must support:

* Search

* Filtering

* Sorting

* Pagination

* Responsive behavior

* Empty states

* Loading states

* Error states

On mobile, transform dense tables into cards where appropriate.

---

# 42. ERROR HANDLING

Never show raw technical errors.

Bad:

```text

TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined

```

Good:

```text

حدث خطأ أثناء تحميل الطلبات.

حاول مرة أخرى.

```

Provide retry actions.

---

# 43. LOADING STATES

Use skeleton loaders.

Do not show blank screens.

Every asynchronous screen should support:

```text

Loading

Success

Empty

Error

```

---

# 44. EMPTY STATES

Examples:

No deliveries:

```text

مفيش توصيلات لسه

لما تنشئ أول طلب توصيل، هتظهر تفاصيله هنا.

```

No captains:

```text

لا يوجد كباتن متاحين حالياً

```

Make empty states useful, not decorative.

---

# 45. SECURITY

Follow secure frontend practices.

Never:

* expose secrets

* expose service-role keys

* hardcode API credentials

* store sensitive credentials insecurely

* trust client-side roles blindly

Use backend authorization/RLS where Supabase is used.

Admin functionality must be protected.

---

# 46. AUDIT LOG

Create an audit log model.

Record important actions:

```text

Order created

Order assigned

Order cancelled

Captain approved

Merchant approved

Pricing changed

Zone changed

Admin login

Status changed

```

Show:

* Actor

* Action

* Entity

* Timestamp

---

# 47. ANALYTICS

Admin analytics:

### Delivery volume

* Today

* This week

* This month

### Delivery performance

* Average delivery time

* Completion rate

* Failure rate

* Cancellation rate

### Captain performance

* Deliveries

* Rating

* Acceptance rate

* Earnings

### Merchant performance

* Orders

* Successful deliveries

* Average delivery time

* Total delivery spend

Use realistic demo data.

---

# 48. DASHBOARD VISUALIZATION

Use clean charts.

Examples:

* Delivery volume line chart

* Revenue bar chart

* Status donut chart

* Captain performance chart

* Zone performance chart

Charts must remain readable in Arabic RTL.

---

# 49. MVP SCOPE

Prioritize these features first:

## Phase 1

### Core

* Authentication

* Role-based dashboards

* Merchant delivery creation

* Captain delivery acceptance

* Delivery status lifecycle

* Customer tracking

* Admin dashboard

* Service zones

* Pricing

* Notifications

* Demo data

* Arabic/English

* RTL/LTR

* Light/Dark

Do NOT overbuild payment gateways, advanced AI, complex fleet management, or real GPS infrastructure in the first version.

---

# 50. PHASE 2

Prepare architecture for:

* Real GPS tracking

* WebSockets / Supabase Realtime

* Push notifications

* Digital wallets

* Online payment

* Captain wallet

* Merchant billing

* Scheduled deliveries

* Delivery batching

* Multiple packages

* Proof of delivery

* OTP delivery confirmation

---

# 51. PHASE 3

Future capabilities:

### Smart Dispatch

Automatically select captain based on:

```text

Distance

Current workload

Vehicle capacity

Captain rating

Zone

Estimated arrival

Historical performance

```

Potential scoring:

```text

CaptainScore =

DistanceWeight

+ AvailabilityWeight

+ PerformanceWeight

+ ZoneWeight

+ CapacityWeight

```

Keep this as future architecture, not MVP complexity.

---

# 52. PHASE 4

Future B2B logistics:

Allow merchants to:

* Manage branches

* Create bulk deliveries

* Import CSV orders

* Track all shipments

* Generate reports

* Manage staff

* Configure delivery rules

---

# 53. DESIGN QUALITY BAR

The application must look like a serious startup product that could be presented to investors or used as a portfolio project.

Do NOT produce:

* generic dashboard templates

* excessive gradients

* random glassmorphism

* huge rounded cards everywhere

* inconsistent spacing

* excessive shadows

* placeholder lorem ipsum

* fake random statistics without labels

* generic SaaS illustrations

Design should feel:

**Modern Egyptian Logistics + Mobility Technology.**

---

# 54. UX DETAILS

Important UX behaviors:

### Delivery creation

Use a multi-step or intelligently grouped form:

```text

1. Pickup

2. Destination

3. Package

4. Delivery options

5. Price

6. Confirmation

```

Show progress.

---

# 55. DELIVERY CONFIRMATION

Before submitting:

Display:

```text

Pickup

Destination

Package

Distance

Estimated time

Delivery price

COD

Special instructions

```

Then:

# Confirm Delivery

---

# 56. DELIVERY TRACKING

Tracking should visually communicate:

```text

✓ الطلب اتعمل

✓ الكابتن اتعيّن

✓ الكابتن في الطريق

✓ استلم الطلب

● الطلب في الطريق

○ تم التسليم

```

Make this extremely clear.

---

# 57. TRUST & SAFETY

Create a trust layer.

Show:

* Captain rating

* Verified status

* Delivery history

* Support access

* Order ID

* Delivery timeline

Do not make unsupported claims such as "insured" or "government approved".

Only display capabilities actually implemented.

---

# 58. DEMO DATA

Create realistic Egyptian demo data.

Merchants:

```text

مخبز الرحمة

ماركت المدينة

صيدلية النور

مطعم بيت العيلة

محل البركة

حلويات طنطا

طنطا - منطقة الاستاد

Package:

Food

COD:

250 EGP

Delivery:

35 EGP

Captain:

محمد السيد

Status:

IN_TRANSIT

```

This order should be usable throughout the demo UI.

---

# 60. LANDING PAGE

Create a public landing page.

Hero:

# "كل طلباتك...

توصّلها توكلي."

Subheadline:

"من المحل لباب العميل، توصيل محلي أسرع وأسهل باستخدام شبكة كباتن توك توك."

Primary CTA:

**ابدأ كتاجر**

Secondary CTA:

**انضم ككابتن**

Hero visual:

Avoid cartoon style.

Use premium realistic/local visual direction.

---

# 61. LANDING PAGE SECTIONS

Include:

1. Hero

2. How it works

3. For merchants

4. For customers

5. For captains

6. Why TukTok delivery

7. Delivery tracking preview

8. Service zones

9. Statistics

10. FAQ

---

# 62. LANDING PAGE COPY

Use real product language.

Example:

### For Merchants

"خلي التوصيل علينا، وركز في شغلك."

### For Captains

"خلي التوصيلات توصلك بدل ما تدور على الشغل."

### For Customers

"طلبك في الطريق... وتقدر تتابعه لحظة بلحظة."

Avoid exaggerated marketing claims.

Avoid:

```css

!important

```

unless genuinely necessary.

Do not repeatedly redefine the same styles.

Do not create multiple competing versions of the same component.

Tailwind should be the primary styling approach.

---

# 68. ACCESSIBILITY

Support:

* keyboard navigation

* semantic HTML

* visible focus states

* sufficient contrast

* screen-reader labels

* accessible dialogs

* accessible form validation

Do not rely only on color to communicate status.

---

# 69. SEO

Public pages should have:

* proper title

* description

* semantic headings

* Open Graph metadata

* favicon

* meaningful URLs

Authenticated dashboards do not need unnecessary SEO complexity.

---

# 70. PERFORMANCE

Optimize for:

* lazy-loaded routes

* optimized images

* minimized unnecessary re-renders

* efficient lists

* pagination

* caching

* debounced search

* lightweight animations

Do not load huge assets unnecessarily.

---

# 71. IMAGE STRATEGY

Use high-quality local or properly licensed assets.

Preferred imagery:

* Egyptian urban streets

* local stores

* modern TukToks

* packages

* delivery scenes

* merchants

* captains

* neighborhoods

Do NOT use:

* random unrelated stock photos

* images with wrong cultural context

* fake logos

* copyrighted brand imagery

* broken external image URLs

Keep image paths centralized.

---

# 72. MOCK API / DATA LAYER

Even if using mock data initially, do NOT directly scatter mock arrays across components.

Create:

```text

services/

data/

types/

```

Example:

```text

deliveryService

merchantService

captainService

zoneService

analyticsService

```

This allows replacing mock services with Supabase/API implementations later.

---

# 73. FORM VALIDATION

Use schema-based validation.

Validate:

* phone

* required fields

* package weight

* address

* COD amount

* delivery zone

* package dimensions

Display Arabic validation messages.

Example:

"من فضلك أدخل عنوان الاستلام."

---

# 74. BUSINESS RULES

Implement basic rules:

1. Delivery must have pickup and destination.

2. Pickup and destination must be inside supported service zones.

3. Package must be within configured vehicle capacity.

4. Delivery price must come from pricing configuration.

5. Only eligible captains can receive a delivery.

6. Only assigned captain can change active delivery state.

7. Delivered orders cannot be edited.

8. Cancelled orders cannot continue.

9. COD must be non-negative.

10. Every important state change must create a timeline record.

---

# 75. ADMIN BUSINESS CONTROLS

Admin should be able to configure:

```text

Service Zones

Pricing

Package Types

Delivery Priorities

Captain Status

Merchant Status

Delivery Status

Operating Hours

```

Do not hardcode these rules in multiple places.

---

# 76. AUDITABILITY

Every critical mutation should be traceable.

Example:

```text

Admin Ahmed changed pricing rule

Zone: Tanta

Old base fee: 20

New base fee: 25

Timestamp: ...

```

---

# 77. TESTING

Create a testing strategy.

At minimum test:

### Delivery state transitions

### Pricing calculation

### Zone validation

### Authentication routing

### Role permissions

### Form validation

### Language switching

### RTL layout

### Responsive layouts

---

# 78. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

The project is NOT complete unless:

* App starts successfully

* Production build succeeds

* TypeScript has no blocking errors

* No broken routes

* No broken images

* No console errors

* Arabic works

* English works

* RTL works

* LTR works

* Light mode works

* Dark mode works

* Mobile works

* Desktop works

* Customer flow works

* Merchant flow works

* Captain flow works

* Admin flow works

* Demo data works

* Delivery state machine works

* Pricing works

* Service zones work

* Tracking demo works

* Notifications work

* Search/filtering works

* Empty states work

* Loading states work

* Error states work

---

# 79. IMPORTANT LOVABLE EXECUTION RULE

Do not stop after generating the UI.

Actually implement the flows.

After implementation:

1. Run the application.

2. Inspect every route.

3. Test every primary CTA.

4. Test navigation.

5. Test forms.

6. Test language switch.

7. Test RTL.

8. Test dark mode.

9. Test mobile layout.

10. Test demo login.

11. Test merchant delivery creation.

12. Test captain acceptance.

13. Test delivery status transitions.

14. Test customer tracking.

15. Test admin dashboard.

16. Fix all errors.

17. Run production build.

18. Fix all build/type errors.

19. Remove unused code.

20. Remove duplicated styles/components.

Do not report "implemented" until the application has actually been verified.

---

# 80. FINAL PRODUCT QUALITY

The final result should feel like:

### A real Egyptian logistics startup MVP

not:

### A generated dashboard template.

The strongest experience should be:

**Merchant creates delivery → system prices it → captain accepts → captain picks up → customer tracks → captain delivers → system records earnings and analytics.**

That single workflow must be extremely polished.

---

# 81. DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY

Build in this exact order:

### STEP 1

Design system + branding.

### STEP 2

Application shell + navigation.

### STEP 3

Authentication + roles.

### STEP 4

Merchant dashboard.

### STEP 5

Delivery creation.

### STEP 6

Captain dashboard.

### STEP 7

Captain assignment.

### STEP 8

Delivery lifecycle.

### STEP 9

Customer tracking.

### STEP 10

Admin operations dashboard.

### STEP 11

Service zones.

### STEP 12

Pricing engine.

### STEP 13

Notifications.

### STEP 14

Analytics.

### STEP 15

Support.

### STEP 16

Responsive/mobile optimization.

### STEP 17

Arabic/English QA.

### STEP 18

Accessibility.

### STEP 19

Performance optimization.

### STEP 20

Production build verification.

---

# 82. DO NOT OVERENGINEER THE MVP

Avoid implementing prematurely:

* Microservices

* Complex event sourcing

* Blockchain

* AI dispatch

* Advanced route optimization

* Real payment gateway

* Full accounting system

* Complex warehouse management

* Full ERP

Design extension points for them, but keep the MVP maintainable.

---

# 83. THE CORE DIFFERENTIATOR

The application should communicate this clearly:

## TUKLY is not another delivery marketplace.

It is:

# "The delivery operating system for local Egyptian merchants powered by TukToks."

Focus on:

**Local commerce**

+

**Affordable last-mile logistics**

+

**TukTok network**

+

**Merchant tools**

+

**Real-time operations**

---

# 84. FINAL INSTRUCTION

Build the application as a coherent product.

Do not generate disconnected pages.

Every screen must connect to a real business flow.

Every important action must have:

* loading state

* success state

* error state

* empty state

Use realistic Egyptian data.

Use Arabic-first UX.

Use professional English localization.

Use RTL/LTR correctly.

Use responsive design.

Use clean reusable architecture.

Use centralized design tokens.

Use no emojis as UI icons.

Use no lorem ipsum.

Use no broken images.

Use no fake unsupported claims.

Use no unnecessary complexity.

Most importantly:

# MAKE TUKLY FEEL LIKE A REAL PRODUCT.

The final demo should allow someone to open the application and understand the complete business within 2 minutes:

**Merchant → Delivery → Captain → Tracking → Customer → Delivered → Analytics.**
